## LICENSE

The software is licensed under the MIT license. However, consider that it retrieves data from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Refer also to their licenses.

The system can be adapted to be tile-server agnostic (i.e., use a provider other than Mapbox).
